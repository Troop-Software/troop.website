              Troop <%= Rails.configuration.troop_website.troop_number %> is a scout led troop. This means that the
              scouts decide on the outings that interest them the
              most. They vote on it and with the guidance and support of trained adult leaders, plan and lead these
              events. Scout leaders make sure that each scout takes on different roles. Everything from leadership
              responsibility to cooperative team building is encouraged and taught. Never tried it before? No problem,
              you’ll be learning new skills while you’re having fun. And these are skills you can use for a lifetime.
              Plus, think on this. When Monday morning rolls around, you get to say, “I hiked and fished this weekend. I
              explored an amazing cave and learned rock climbing. I tried skiing and snowboarding and it was great.”

              Your adventure starts here with Boy Scouts. Picture yourself open tent camping below a million visible

              cavern
              or
              horseback riding through a sandy limestone valley? Have you ever thought of canoeing on a crystal clear
              lake,
              or whitewater rafting in a trout-filled river? With Boy Scout

              adventure,
